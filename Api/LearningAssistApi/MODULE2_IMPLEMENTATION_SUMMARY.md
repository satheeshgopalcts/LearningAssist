## Key Features Implemented

### Course Management
1. **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete courses with comprehensive validation
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Search by title, instructor, categories, tags, difficulty, rating, duration
3. **Pagination**: Efficient pagination with configurable page sizes
4. **Enrollment System**: User enrollment/unenrollment with progress tracking
5. **Rating System**: 5-star rating with reviews and tags
6. **Statistics**: Real-time course statistics including enrollments, ratings, completion rates

### Learning Path Management
1. **Course Sequencing**: Ordered course progression with prerequisites
2. **Automatic Enrollment**: Enrolling in learning path automatically enrolls in constituent courses
3. **Progress Aggregation**: Combined progress tracking across all courses in the path
4. **Flexible Structure**: Support for required/optional courses and unlocking mechanisms
5. **Certification**: Certificate generation upon completion
6. **Complex Filtering**: Multi-dimensional filtering by various criteria
